Usage:

	1) Create a new document
		1.1) Set the size of the page to the actual pixel-size you want
				for your presentation.
	2) Make sure you have 2 layers
		2.1) The bottom layer for graphics, the top for layout
	3) Create your graphics
		3.1) Make sure all your graphics are within the bounds of 
				the page, and only on the bottom layer.
	4) Create your layout
		4.1) Each rect you put in the layout layer, will be a step in the
				presentation.
		4.2) z-order will dictate presentation order (bottom to top)
		4.3) Feel free to scale and rotate your frames.
		*) Make sure you don't have any 180 degree rotations - they are not
				handled correctly for now.
	5) Save your presentation
		5.1) Save your file as a plain SVG (not Inkscape-SVG)
	6) Run the convertion script
		6.1) python ink2impress.py <source-svg> <target-html>
	7) And that's it!
